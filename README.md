## Description
PsVitaThemeBuilder is a java based application to create and personalize your themes in an easy and fast way. It's available for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

## Usage
To create a theme, you will only need to provide this information:
- Theme Title
- Author Name
- LockScreen Image Path
- First Page Image Path

All other information is totally optional. Colors are predefined but you can change them though.

## External Tool
As you probably know, PsVita Themes can include music and I of course took that into account.
  To take advantage of this option, you have to use Microsoft Windows since PsVitaThemeBuilder uses [`at9tool.exe`](https://amicitiamods.jcink.net/index.php?s=c0de8c821d4862b3d66975cc0f3a558f&showtopic=29&st=0&#entry56) to convert `.WAV` files to `.AT9` format.
  In a future I'll try to make possible to use this feature in Linux. Anyway, if you already have the `BGM.at9` file you can just drag and drop it to your theme folder.
  
  ``` 
 at9tool.exe MUST be in the same folder as the .jar file 
 ```
